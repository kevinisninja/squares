# Squares
A pretty basic game based on the idea of the n_back memory test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back). At every round one square lights up and to proceed you must choose the square that was lit n turns ago. Right now only modes with up to n = 4 are available, because I think it's simply too hard for anything more. Soon to be released on the app store!
